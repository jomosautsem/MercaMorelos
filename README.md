# MercaMorelos Frontend

This is the React frontend for the MercaMorelos e-commerce application. It is currently configured to run with mock data, so no backend is required.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

To start the Vite development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
